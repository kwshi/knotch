# "Knots" - Kye's Number to Text Shifter
*Don't know how to say it? We'll teach you!*

Inspired by [Project Euler's problem 17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17), I decided to make a script that quickly converts *any* integer into English. Unlike other projects of the kind, this module *fully complies* with standards of British usage (including [placement of the word "and"](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/111765/how-to-write-out-numbers-in-compliance-with-british-usage) and hyphens ("twenty**-**three")) and can truly support numbers up to infinity (or as much as Python can handle) by generating words on-the-fly using the [Conway-Wechsler system](http://www.mrob.com/pub/math/largenum.html#conway-wechsler) of large numbers.
